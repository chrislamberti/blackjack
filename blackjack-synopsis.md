This project was focused on stress testing basic skills in javascript through the scrimba course.
Here I learned basic syntax including:
- strings, numbers & booleans
- objects (arrays & functions)
- if else statements
- variables
- for loops
- logical and comparison operators

Detailed synopsis:
- defined card array and redefined it in the startGame() function combined with multiple items, and pushed it to the array using cards.push(card)
- created a player object containing key value pairs
- named booleans that defined the state of the game using true and false, defining if a player is still playing eg - isAlive = true and if that same player has won blackjack or not eg - hasBlackJack = false
- added if, else if, else statements and used comparison operators to define conditions when I wanted code to run in if else statements
- used logical operator (&&) that checks if conditions are true, to run the code in if statements
- used for loops to iterate through cards array and render out each of the cards
- created getRandomCard() function using the math object that floors numbers
- used return statements to return values
